# 🎭 Playwright-Automation-with-TypeScript
This project demonstrates end-to-end UI automation using Playwright with Page Object Model (POM) design and also with Jenkins CI/CD.

The demo tests are performed on Practice Test Automation
.

## 📌 Features

✅ Automated Login, Logout, Form & Error handling flows

✅ Page Object Model (POM) for reusable test code

✅ Screenshots on test failures for debugging

✅ Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

✅ HTML test reports viewable with npx playwright show-report

✅ Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline integration for automated execution

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Playwright
 – Automation framework
 – POM frameword

TypeScript
 – Strongly typed scripting

Node.js
 – Runtime environment

[Jest / Playwright Test Runner] – Test execution & reporting

Jenkins
 – CI/CD pipeline

## ⚡ Setup & Installation

Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/playwright-automation.git
cd playwright-automation
```


Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## ▶️ Running Tests

Run all tests

```bash
npx test
```

Run tests with browser UI (headed mode)

```bash
npx test --headed
```

Run a specific test file

```bash
npx test tests/login.spec.ts
```

Run with HTML report
```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

##  📊 Reports & Screenshots

After every test run, an HTML report is generated in the reports/ folder.

To open it in browser:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

On test failures, screenshots are automatically captured and saved in screenshots/.


##  🚀 Jenkins CI/CD

- This project is integrated with Jenkins Pipeline to:
- Run tests automatically on each code push
- Publish Playwright HTML reports as build artifacts

Create Jenkinsfile
```bash
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                script {
                    checkout([$class: 'GitSCM',
                        branches: [[name: 'main']],
                        userRemoteConfigs: [[
                            url: 'https://github.com/roshan-khichi/Playwright-Automation-with-TypeScript.git',
                            credentialsId: 'jenkins_token'  // Use the ID from Jenkins credentials
                        ]]
                    ])
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                bat 'npm install'
                bat 'npx playwright install'
            }
        }

        stage('Run Playwright Tests') {
            steps {
                bat 'npm run test-and-email'
            }
        }
    }
}
